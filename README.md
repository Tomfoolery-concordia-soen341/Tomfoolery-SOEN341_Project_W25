# Introduction

Welcome to Team TomFoolery's github repository for ChatHaven.

## Description

ChatHaven is a communication platform for users to send messages either directly to other users or through a text channel. The users can send messages and share various media files to others. It is maintained by various roles in the system such that each text channel is maintained and well managed for the best user experience.

This application features a role base system to make users interact differently from admins on ChatHaven. Users can chat and interact with each other while Admins can make channels, and moderate the group chats. The system also allows users to register and login easily using Firebase's integrated login system.
