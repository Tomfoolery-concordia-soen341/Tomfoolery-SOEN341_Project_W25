# Description
We are tasked with the mission to build a communication website that is useable and marketable. This web-application must be useful for anyone who wants to communicate to a friend or group. Each user will be able to customize their profile and enjoy a user-friendly page with an amazing UI.
# Technology and tools used

- React <br>
React will be our main library to create the front-end and also back-end at the same time. It is using the JavaScript language to code everything with a mix of HTML when we want to display a page. <br/>
- JavaScript <br/>
This language is new to everyone as all of the team are new to web-development. It is the main language we will use to work the entire code. <br/>
- CSS <br/>
This is also new to the entire team, as it will be a way for us to make the UI better looking and more user friendly. <br/>
- HTML <br/>
This will help us set-up the elements on the page and make sure that they work as intended, using the functions created in JavaScript. <br/>
- FireBase (+ Firestore database) <br/>
Firebase will serve as our method of making the front end and make simple functions. All the data that we will need to store will be on Firestore. Our database for the backend is where all the data will manipulated. <br/>
